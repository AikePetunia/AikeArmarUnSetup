# AikeArmarUnSetup  
Aike (my name) + "Armar un setup".  
It makes sense in Spanish xD.  

This is a personal project, not actively coding right now, but the goal is to get all the prices from the most popular Argentinian websites for setup-related products. From desktops and chairs to PC components.  

I don't have a database of the stock from these websites, so it's just a scraper for now. You have to manually specify which page you want to scrape. It's too raw at the moment.  

## Scraped pages so far:  
- **CompraGamer**  
- **HardGamers**  
- **710tech**  

## Setup:  
```sh
npm init playwright@latest
